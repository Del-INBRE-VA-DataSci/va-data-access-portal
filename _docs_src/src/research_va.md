# Engaging in VA Research

Research partnerships to improve and enhance the health and healthcare of Veterans is a priority for the Wilmington VAMC. We welcome and encourage partnerships with VA intramural researchers and with researchers from outside of the VA.

## **Collaborate** with a VA researcher or VA health services

- Search the VA Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) Directory to find VA researchers who share your research interests.  [HSR&D Directory (va.gov)](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/for_researchers/directory/)
- Visit the Wilmington VAMC at Research & Development Resources page to learn about its research priorities.
- Delaware INBRE associated faculty/investigators can [complete this form](https://de-inbre.org/delaware-inbre-and-wilmington-va-medical-center-wvamc-research-collaboration-form/).


## **Join the VA**

Types of appointments:

- __*Unpaid*, without compensation (WOC) appointment__ - will allow you to work with a VA investigator or health services employee, apply for VA funding, and access VA data sources. To learn more visit [WOC 101](https://www.research.va.gov/resources/policies/guidance/WOC-Checklist.pdf). TODO: WOC link broken
- **University-VA joint appointment (paid and unpaid)** – will allow you to apply for VA or extramural funding (such as NIH, DOD, NSF, etc.) and conduct your research at or in partnership with the VA.
- **Intergovernment Personnel Act (IPA) assignment** – a temporary assignment made for people who work outside the VA to be paid with VA research funds. For example, a person (not the PI) with a university appointment might be approved and funded to perform VA research, but they do not want to give up their university appointment.
- **Paid positions**, visit the VA Office of Research and Development website for a list of open [Research positions](https://www.research.va.gov/about/employment.cfm) and/or search [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/).
