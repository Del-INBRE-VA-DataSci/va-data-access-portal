# VA Data Access Guide

This site holds the documentation for the Wilmington VA Data Access Portal, a project to facilitate collaboration between the VA and other Delaware INBRE institutions.

The Wilmington Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) offers data access and sharing to researchers interested in Veteran's health, especially partner institutions of the Delaware IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence ([DE-INBRE](https://de-inbre.org/)). This website provides a clear pathway for researchers from affiliated institutions to request and securely obtain relevant data, ensuring compliance with all regulatory requirements. Here, you'll find procedures, forms, and FAQs to streamline the process for productive research collaborations.
